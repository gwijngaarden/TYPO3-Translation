How we made friends with TYPO3
Jim and Marshall don't know each other - but they have one thing in common: they use their SONY PlayStation to play games, listen to music and watch movies. Using the PlayStation Network they regularly play together and soon find out they all live just round the block from each other. While still playing together online they now also meet in the real world to play ball and listen to their favorite tunes.

SONY PlayStation Network in numbers
More than 110 million users worldwide use the PlayStation Network - or PSN for short - to download or stream games, movies, music or apps. PSN stores are available in 51 countries and provide access to their services 24/7. All content is available for desktop PC, laptops, tablets and smartphones as well as on SONY PlayStation platforms, making PSN a truly cross-platform service. With over 131,000 employees SONY generates a total turnover of more than 8 billion Yen per year.

Challenges
At that time Sony was already successfully running the Sony Entertainment Network across 57 countries and in 14 languages based on an existing static portal. With its static approach the deployment process for new content became lengthy and unstable for the still growing  platform and their increasing volume of subscriptions.

Sony needed to change something major to stabilize that content creation and publishing processes and decided to migrate all of its existing static content to the Enterprise Web Content Management System TYPO3.
