Keeping a Clear Vision with TYPO3
There are people wearing UVEX glasses because they simply look gorgeous, but Jenny knows more about UVEX than that. Whenever she pushes herself past limits during sports, she knows that UVEX is a reliable partner in safety.

Starting with eye-protection, necessary in the heights of the alps whist traversing to the top of the glacier, to the helmet and the full body protector - Jenny rides safe.


Ever since the company was founded in 1926, the Uvex brand has been synonymous with top-quality and innovative products that provide head-to-toe protection for sports, leisure and work. 
Family owned for 80 years, in 2009 the total revenue for the Uvex group was €290.4 million. 
Their products are made almost exclusively in Germany and Europe, with a commitment to excellence that makes them a global partner on the international elite sports scene, 
providing equipment for more than 1,000 top athletes. 

Uvex has run their global web infrastructure entirely on TYPO3 for many years now and has been convinced by its cost-efficiency and flexibility as well as internationalisation features.
